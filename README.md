Just a fun thing I made one afternoon. Inspired by http://cachemonet.com. Enter a tumblr tag for background and foreground, give it some sound by entering a Youtube click. Bask in the randomized gifs.

It'll take your provided tags and add "gif" to it, unfortunately Tumblr doesn't allow multiple tags in their "tagged" api, so I'm making do with this for the time being. So if it doesn't come up with stuff or there aren't many results it's probably because people don't typically tag things with "subject gif" that often anyway. If we had multiple tag search it would be way more boss. (TUMBLR PLS)
