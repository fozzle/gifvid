GifVid
======

Inspired by http://cachemonet.com. Enter a tumblr tag for background and foreground, give it some sound by entering a Youtube click. Bask in the randomized gifs.

Uses Giphy API for gifs.

You can also link it to people if you serendipitously get some good tag/sound action. http://kpetrovi.ch/gifvid/?background=pizza&foreground=balloons&music=http%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2Fpq7xrO2q2yM&timing=1
